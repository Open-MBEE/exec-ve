View Editor (VE) is a web-based environment designed to interact with a
systems model. VE is a document oriented view of the model elements,
which are stored in OpenMBEE's Model Management Server (MMS). Its purpose is to provide real and
true data through the web so that users may interact with actual model
elements without having to open a modeling software (e.g. MagicDraw ).
This allows users of all levels, including non-modelers, to view or
modify live documents and values of a singular source of truth.
