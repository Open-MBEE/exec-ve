Navigation and Viewing

View Editor offers many ways to interact with model elements. The
following subviews are provided to demonstrate various interactive
capabilities.

Navigate To A Project
======================

**Orgs** are a configuration-managed collection of projects.

**Projects** are collections of Documents and Views and their related
elements. They correspond to SysML models.

-  |image1|\ \ **Views** are individual parts of a document. They can be
   specialized to have their own content and layout.

-  **§ Sections** are subsections of Views. They are similar to views in
   the sense that they provide a specific amount of information, contain
   presentation elements, and can be cross referenced.

-  To filter by type and display **tables** , **images**, and
   **equations** in the tree, use the **tree filter** |image2|

View Modes
~~~~~~~~~~

Toggle |image3|\ **Full document/View mode** in the upper left

-  In **View mode**, one view and its sections are shown at a time

   -  Use the **arrows in the upper right tool bar**\ |image4| to
      navigate through views and sections.

-  In **Full Document mode**, the entire contents of a document are
   shown at once

For more information on adding, editing, and saving views, refer to
`Documents and
Views <#groups-documents-and-views>`__.

For more information on Sections, see `Add Presentation

From a high level perspective, View Editor Tasks are similar to Git
branches. They create a separate workspace built upon a duplication of
data at a specified time. View Editor Tags are "snapshots" of all the
data on View Editor at specified times.
